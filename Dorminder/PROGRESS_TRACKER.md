## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### **Front-end Architecture**
```javascript
// Component Structure
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ common/           // Reusable UI components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ forms/            // Form-specific components
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ navigation/       // Navigation components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screens/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth/            // Authentication screens
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tenant/          // Tenant-specific screens
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ landlord/        // Landlord-specific screens
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contexts/             // React Context providers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/                // Custom React hooks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/                // Helper functions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/               // Images, icons, fonts
```

### **State Management Strategy**
```javascript
// Context Structure
UserContext: {
  user: null,
  isAuthenticated: false,
  login: (email, password) => {},
  logout: () => {},
  updateProfile: (data) => {}
}

DashboardContext: {
  activeTab: 'dashboard',
  refreshData: () => {},
  notifications: []
}

ThemeContext: {
  isDarkMode: false,
  toggleTheme: () => {},
  colors: {...}
}
```

### **Firebase Integration Points**
```javascript
// Key Firebase Services
Authentication: Email/Password, Google OAuth
Firestore: Real-time database for all app data
Storage: Profile images, document uploads
Functions: Serverless backend logic
Analytics: User behavior tracking
```

## üö® RISK MITIGATION

### **Technical Risks**
- **Firebase Configuration**: Start with simple setup, add complexity gradually
- **State Management**: Use Context API initially, migrate to Redux if needed
- **Performance**: Implement lazy loading and image optimization early

### **Timeline Risks**
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to MVP features, add extras post-launch
- **Testing Delays**: Start testing early, parallel with development
- **Platform Issues**: Test on both iOS and Android throughout development
